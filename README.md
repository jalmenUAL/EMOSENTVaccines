This tool carries out a lexicon-based detection of sentiment polarity and emotions from texts about vaccines. Using the Stanza library it builds a dependence tree of the words ocurring in the text and using a corpus of annotated words with polarity and emotions computes the polarity of the sentence as well as a set of emotions. The corpus is an extension of the SO-cal corpus adapted to the health and vaccines domain.
The tool has been implemented in Python.
The corpus is available in the newdata folder.
